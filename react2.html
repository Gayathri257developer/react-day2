<h2>2. What is the package name you are using for routing?</h2>
<p><strong>React Router DOM</strong> is an npm package that enables you to implement dynamic routing in a web app. It allows you to display pages and allow users to navigate them.</p>
<hr/>

<h2>3. Routing Implementation?</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Step 1: Install react-router-dom  : </strong>
    npm install react-router-dom <br/> <br/>
   <strong>    Step 2: Importing react-router-dom in our project  :</strong>
    In the above code, we have wrapped our "App" component with "BrowserRouter" which enables us to use Html 5 history API. <br/><br/>
   <strong>Step 3: Implement Routing : </strong>
   In app.js we need to implement Routers cases with various routes.
Each Route component needs two mandatory props and that is the path and the component to render.
</p>

<h2> 4. How do you pass data from parent to child ?</h2>
<p>By using props, Create react application
    Setup input element in Parent component
    Handle value from parent in Child component</p>
<pre>
    import React, { Component } from 'react';
import Child from './Child';

class App extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      inputVal: 'Clue Mediator'
    }
    this.onInputChange = this.onInputChange.bind(this);
  }

  onInputChange(e) {
    this.setState({ inputVal: e.target.value });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <>
        <h4>Parent Component</h4>
       < input value={this.state.inputVal} onChange={this.onInputChange} />

       < Child elementValue={this.state.inputVal} />
      </ >
    );
  }
}

export default App;
</pre>
<hr/>
<pre>
    import React, { Component } from 'react';

class Child extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <>
        <h3>Child Component</h3>
        Input Value: {this.props.elementValue}
      </>
    );
  }
}

export default Child;
</pre>
<hr/>

<h2>5. What is lazy loading in react ?</h2>
<p>Lazy loading is the technique of rendering only-needed or critical user interface items first, then quietly unrolling the non-critical items later. It is now fully integrated into core react library itself.</p>

<hr/>

<h2>6. Difference b/w Stateful and stateless Component ?</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Stateless components : </strong> are simple functional component without having a local state but there is a hook in react to add state behavior in functional component as well.
 <br><br>   <strong>Stateful components : </strong> are always class components. It have a state that gets initialized in the constructor. We've created a state object and initialized it with a count of 0.
</p>
<hr/>

<h2>7. How do you switch one component to another ?</h2>
<p>Link, NavLink, useNavigate, Conditional render </p>
